# Clean XHTML Plus for Flare

This project contains a Python script, JavaScript, and CSS that allow you to use the following HTML5 features in CleanÂ XHTML outputs:
Togglers

* Drop-down text
* Expanding text
* Text popups
* Topic popups

In addition to allowing you to use these features in Clean XHTML outputs, Clean XHTML Plus also allows you to:

* Insert character-level formatting in text popups.
* Insert the content of topic popups directly in the topics in which you are inserting the topic popup links (rather than having to create separate popup topics).
* Use topic popups in HTM5 outputs with side or top navigation skins. (The native topic popup feature in Flare is diabled for these types of outputs.)

Build the read-me.fltar output to view detaield instructions for adding Clean XHTML Plus feature to your Flare projects.
